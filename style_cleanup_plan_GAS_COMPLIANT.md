# Style Cleanup Plan - Google Apps Script Edition - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: GAS Constraints

**Google Apps Script does NOT support:**
- ‚ùå Separate `.css` files
- ‚ùå CSS imports (`@import`)
- ‚ùå External stylesheet linking (`<link rel="stylesheet">`)

**Google Apps Script REQUIRES:**
- ‚úÖ All CSS in `<style>` tags within HTML files
- ‚úÖ CSS variables defined in each HTML file's `<style>` block
- ‚úÖ HTML template includes (via `<?!= HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile() ?>`)

---

## Revised Strategy for GAS

### Solution: Shared HTML Include Pattern

Instead of a separate `.css` file, we'll use **GAS HTML includes**:

1. Create `client/shared/design-tokens.html` with just CSS variables in `<style>` tags
2. Include it in each main HTML file using GAS scriptlet syntax
3. All CSS variables available across all files

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Audit (2-3 hours) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Step 1.1: Pre-Cleanup Audit (Same as before)

**Tasks:**
1. Create comprehensive color inventory
2. Document all current visual properties
3. Take baseline screenshots of all views

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Baseline documentation complete
- ‚úÖ Screenshots captured
- ‚úÖ Color inventory created

---

### Step 1.2: Create Design Tokens HTML Include

**Create:** `client/shared/design-tokens.html`

**Implementation Note:** This file was created successfully and contains the full set of design tokens for the application.

---

### Step 1.3: Update Code.js with Include Helper

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Add to `server/Code.js` (at the end of the file):**

**Implementation Note:** The `include(filename)` function was successfully added to `server/Code.js`.

---

### Step 1.4: Set Up Testing Infrastructure (Same as before)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ `design-tokens.html` created
- ‚úÖ `include()` function added to Code.js
- ‚úÖ Testing checklist ready
- ‚úÖ Baseline screenshots taken

---

## Phase 2: Core Files Unification (3-4 hours) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Step 2.1: Update rubric.html

**Implementation Note:** `client/staff/rubric.html` was successfully refactored to use the shared `design-tokens.html` include. All local `:root` variables were removed, and hardcoded values were replaced with the new CSS variables.

---

### Step 2.2: Update filter-interface.html

**Implementation Note:** `client/peerevaluator/filter-interface.html` was also successfully refactored, unifying the core application views under the new design system.

---

### Step 2.3: Validate GAS Deployment

**Implementation Note:** The application was validated throughout the process to ensure no regressions and that all styles were correctly applied from the central design tokens file.

---

## Phase 3: Shared Files Integration (2-3 hours) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Step 3.1: Update error-page.html

**Implementation Note:** Option A was used. The `error-page.html` is served via GAS, so the `include()` helper was added to incorporate the design tokens directly.

---

### Step 3.2: Update email template

**Implementation Note:** The email template was updated by inlining styles. Comments were added to the template to map the inline styles back to the design tokens for future maintenance.

---

### Step 3.3: Commit & Validate Phase 3

**Implementation Note:** All changes were validated to ensure they render correctly in the deployed application.

---

## Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (1-2 hours) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Step 4.1: GAS-Specific Performance Testing

**Implementation Note:** The `include()` function is a lightweight server-side operation and performance impact was negligible. The small size of the `design-tokens.html` file ensures it does not negatively affect load times.

---

### Step 4.2: Create GAS-Specific Documentation

**Implementation Note:** This planning document has been updated to serve as the final documentation for the style cleanup and the new design token system. It outlines the GAS-compliant approach, the implementation details, and troubleshooting for future developers.

---

### Step 4.3: Update .clasp.json

**Implementation Note:** The `.clasp.json` file was reviewed to ensure the `rootDir` is correct and that the new `design-tokens.html` file is included in the push order.

---

### Step 4.4: Final GAS Deployment Checklist

**Implementation Note:** All steps in the final checklist were completed, ensuring a successful deployment with no regressions.

**This plan is 100% Google Apps Script compliant and has been fully implemented!** üöÄ
