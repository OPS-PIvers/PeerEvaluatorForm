/**
 * TEST CASE: Clicking the "Best Practices" header should toggle the visibility of the content.
 *
 * Bug Description:
 * The `client/staff/rubric.html` file contained multiple, conflicting implementations of the
 * `toggleLookFors` JavaScript function. This caused unpredictable behavior where only the last
 * defined function would execute, leading to incorrect UI behavior for toggling the "look-fors" section.
 *
 * Fix:
 * All duplicate `toggleLookFors` functions were removed and replaced with a single, consolidated
 * function that correctly handles all use cases (different views, state persistence).
 *
 * MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS:
 *
 * 1.  **SETUP:**
 *     a. Open the web application in a browser.
 *     b. Navigate to a view that displays the rubric (e.g., the main staff view).
 *
 * 2.  **EXECUTION & VERIFICATION:**
 *     a. Find a component on the rubric that has a "Best Practices" section.
 *     b. **Click** on the "Best Practices" header.
 *     c. **Expected Result:** The content area below the header should expand and become visible. The chevron icon (▶) should rotate to point down (▼).
 *     d. **Click** on the "Best Practices" header again.
 *     e. **Expected Result:** The content area should collapse and become hidden. The chevron icon (▼) should rotate back to point right (▶).
 *     f. **Refresh** the page.
 *     g. **Expected Result:** The "Best Practices" section should remember its state. If it was open, it should remain open. If it was closed, it should remain closed. This verifies that state is being correctly saved to sessionStorage.
 *     h. Repeat steps 2a-2e for multiple "Best Practices" sections on the page to ensure they operate independently.
 *
 * 3.  **VERIFICATION (PRE-FIX):**
 *     a. If you were to run this test on the code *before* the fix was applied:
 *     b. **Expected Result:** Depending on which `toggleLookFors` function was the last one to be defined, the toggle might not work at all, or it might work but not save its state on refresh. The behavior would be inconsistent and buggy.
