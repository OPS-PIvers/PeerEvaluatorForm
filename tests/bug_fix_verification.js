/**
 * TEST CASE: Deleting an observation without a Drive folder should not create orphaned folders.
 *
 * Bug Description:
 * The `_deleteRecordAndFolder` function in `server/ObservationService.js` was using a "get or create"
 * function (`_getObservationFolder`) to find the folder to delete. This caused the system to create
 * a new folder structure and then immediately trash it if the folder didn't already exist,
 * leaving orphaned parent directories in Google Drive.
 *
 * Fix:
 * The function was changed to use `getExistingObservationFolder`, which only finds a folder
 * if it exists and does not create one otherwise.
 *
 * MANUAL VERIFICATION STEPS:
 *
 * 1.  **SETUP:**
 *     a. Open the Google Sheet connected to this project.
 *     b. Go to the "Observation_Data" sheet.
 *     c. Create a new dummy row for an observation. You'll need to fill in at least these columns:
 *        - `observationId`: A unique ID, e.g., "test-obs-123"
 *        - `observerEmail`: Your email address.
 *        - `observedEmail`: Any valid email.
 *        - `observedName`: Any name.
 *        - `status`: "Draft"
 *     d. Go to your Google Drive. Ensure that no folder for this observation (`Observation - test-obs-123`) exists.
 *        Specifically, check under the `Peer Evaluator Form Data` folder.
 *
 * 2.  **EXECUTION:**
 *     a. In the Google Apps Script editor, open the `server/Code.js` file (or this file).
 *     b. Create a temporary function to run the test:
 *
 *        function runDeletionTest() {
 *          deleteObservationRecord('test-obs-123', 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE');
 *        }
 *
 *     c. Replace 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE' with the email you used for `observerEmail`.
 *     d. Run the `runDeletionTest` function from the editor.
 *
 * 3.  **VERIFICATION (POST-FIX):**
 *     a. Check your Google Drive again.
 *     b. **Expected Result:** The `Peer Evaluator Form Data` folder (and any user subfolder) should NOT have been created if it didn't already exist. No new folders should appear.
 *     c. Check the "Observation_Data" sheet. The dummy row for "test-obs-123" should be gone.
 *
 * 4.  **VERIFICATION (PRE-FIX):**
 *     a. If you were to run this test on the code *before* the fix was applied:
 *     b. **Expected Result:** A new folder `Peer Evaluator Form Data` would be created in your Drive's root if it wasn't there. Inside it, a folder for the user would be created. The observation folder itself would be created and then trashed. This would leave behind the orphaned parent folders.
