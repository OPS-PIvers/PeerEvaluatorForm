Detailed Gemini Audio Transcription Implementation Plan

  Zero Regression & No Bloat Strategy

  Core Principles

  - Never modify existing functions - only extend or add new ones
  - Isolate all new functionality - can be disabled without affecting existing features
  - Reuse existing patterns - UI components, error handling, caching, etc.
  - Test each component independently before integration
  - Maintain backward compatibility for all existing observation data
